# BeatTikRecordGenerator
This is a small app that can generate recordings for [Neptunia Virtual Stars](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1399840/Neptunia_Virtual_Stars/) (VVVtune)'s [BeatTik](https://neptunia.fandom.com/wiki/BeatTik) minigame so they can be used in the  [Video Battler](https://neptunia.fandom.com/wiki/Video_Battler).

## Why?

BeatTik is incredibly unstable and even more so when you are trying to record it. Crashing occurring is just part of the experience in BeatTik. This is not okay.

So, this app can generate some recordings for you to use in the [Video Battler](https://neptunia.fandom.com/wiki/Video_Battler) to generate some items. The randomness in these recordings will ensure you get a large variety of items.

## Usage

1. Download the jar and double click it
2. Follow the prompts to create as many random recordings as you want
3. ???
4. Profit.

**Note**: Some recordings may not show up if you haven't unlocked the stage or song used in the recording. Therefore, be sure to be as accurate as possible when asked how many BeatTik songs you have unlocked.

**Requires Java 11 or higher to run**
